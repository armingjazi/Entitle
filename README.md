An open source licence management library

It baffles me that there is still no opensource solution for licensing software products. So I decided to make one.

Under construction! when the basic functionality is up an running, I will be adding some issues for people to work on.

This library will consist of two components
 1- a server part, which can be deployed on a remote
 2- a client library that can be used to verify a software with some identification
 
If you feel like this is something you want to work on and want to help with the conception please do not hesitate to contact me.
